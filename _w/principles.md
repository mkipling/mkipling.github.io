title: Principles
author: Ray Dalio

"Your values are what you consider important, literally what you 'value'. Principles are what allow you to live a life consistent with those values. Principles connect your values to your actions; they are beacons that guide your actions, and help you successfully deal with the laws of reality. It is to your principles that you turn when you face hard choices." - Ray Dalio

With these lines early in the book, Ray Dalio outlines a systematic method, tailored to each reader, allowing someone to define
and reach success on their terms. He attempts to tell you how to get what you want, but not what you should want. The simplicity of it is clarifying. What do you value? Stop and think about that. Reflect on your life experiences. Once you've done that, uncover a set of heuristics, rules of thumb, proverbs or principles that you can use to live a life that is consistent with your values. Your principles are what will connect your actions to your values. 

After outlining what the book hopes to achieve, Ray Dalio then outlines some of his values and principles. He tells stories from his own life that illustrate his princples. He recounts times where he failed to act consistently with his values, and the lessons he drew from the bad outsomes that ensued. 

At each stage of the book, he begs you to ask: Is this true?
  
He invites critical reflection on what he's written. He asks you to apply this same ruthless critical reflection on your own life and experiences. Does what you believe match with what you've seen. Do your ideas of how the world works match the outcomes you witness?

With this method in hand, it's possible to begin reflecting on your own life. 

What do I value? Family, progress, balance and care. 

Family are the relationships in your life that give what you do meaning. They're the people that you enjoy sharing your existance with.
  Principles:
    - Choose improvement: relationships are always changing. They either get better, or they wither.
    - Make time: 
    
Progress is the idea that change is constant, and that it has direction: good and bad. When it is good, you get progress. Progress is cumulative.
  Principles:
    - Left hand rule: always do the difficult part first.
    - Compound interest: pay attention to the growth that comes from early and consistent application of effort. 
    - If you don't use it you lose it: progress is temporary, and can be lost through neglect. Constant 
    
Balance means that no one aspect in your life can consume all others. It's the recognition that life is composed of a number of different priorities, none of which should hurt the others.
  Principles:
    - 
    
Care is an approach to the world that treats encounters with respect and deference. 
  Principles:
    - If it's worth doing, do it well.
    - Focus: without focus, you aren't giving your full self to what you're doing, and so the outcome won't be your best.
    - Due time: give things worth doing the time they deserve. Have patients, allow enough time.
