title: Juggling

Juggling is a discipline, and sometimes an art. It is the manipulation of objects, giving them a character that appears to defy physics. 

Becoming proficient at juggling takes qualities that are important to many areas of practice: focus, patience, dedication, preseverance and creativity. 
Toil and frustration give way to the satisfaction of being able to perform a pattern. 

## How?

Common objects used include: balls, clubs, and rings. The objects are often thrown, caught, balanced, rolled and bounced in increasingly complex patterns. 

There is a hierarchy to juggling, where simple patterns are built on to create more complex patterns. 

Juggling can be personalized by the choice of: pattern, tempo, shape, transitions, objects and mood. 

Some notes on improving:
- Practice the left hand first (your non-dominant hand). Juggling is a balanced activity, and both sides of your body need to be strong.
- Reduce patterns to simpler components, and practice those separately before combining. 

At the highest levels objects develop personality, they become animated with energy and emotion. Juggling becomes performance, and sometimes high art.
