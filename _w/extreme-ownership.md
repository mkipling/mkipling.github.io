This is a book about leadership, written by a former US Navy SEALs Commander. 

The central theme is that a leader is responsible for all outcomes, good or bad, no matter the circumstances. The mindset that you, as a leader, own all outcomes is shown to be transformational. When no excuses are accepted, initiative increases, attention to detail increases, preparation increases, team morale increases, trust increases, and so success increases.

"In order to convince and inspire otherse to follow and accomplish a mission, a leader must be a true believer in the mission."

Principle: Ego clouds and disrupts everything.

Principle: Cover and Move: "the most fundamental tactic, perhaps the only tactic. Simply put, Cover and Move means teamwork. All elements within the greater team are crucial and must work together to accomplish the mission, mutually supporting one another for that singular purpose."
