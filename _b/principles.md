title: Principles
author: Ray Dalio
---

"Your values are what you consider important, literally what you “value.” Principles are what allow
you to live a life consistent with those values. Principles connect your values to your actions; they
are beacons that guide your actions, and help you successfully deal with the laws of reality. It is
to your principles that you turn when you face hard choices."

With these lines early in the book, Ray Dalio outlines a systematic method, tailored to each reader, which allows someone to define
and reach success on their terms.
