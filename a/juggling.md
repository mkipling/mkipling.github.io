## What is?

Juggling is a practice, and sometimes an art. It is the manipulation of objects, giving them a character that appears to defy physics. 

## Why?

Becoming proficient at juggling takes qualities that are important to many areas of practice: focus, patience, dedication, preseverance and creativity. 
Toil and frustration give way to the satisfaction of being able to perform a pattern. 

## How?

Common objects used include: balls, clubs, and rings. The objects are often thrown, caught, balanced, rolled and bounced in increasingly complex patterns. 

There is a hierarchy to juggling, where simple patterns are built on to create more complex patterns. 

Juggling can be personalized by the choice of: pattern, tempo, shape, transitions, objects and mood. 

In rare cases, objects juggled take on a personality, they become animated with energy and emotion. Juggling becomes performance, and can evoke emotions.
