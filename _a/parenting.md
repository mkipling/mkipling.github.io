What does it mean to be a parent, and how do I do it well?

A parent is a primary person responsible for guiding and protecting a child into adulthood. Guiding deals with what to teach. Protecting is providing security and health.

For me, guiding a child means instilling values, and developing skills that will let them live a life they choose.

What values?

Character:

Kind
- Treats people the way they want to be treated.

Moral
- Believes that there is a good and a bad, and wants to do good. 

Competent
- Able to create outcomes they consciously choose.

Resilient
- Persistently pursues goals, in spite of adversity. 

Humble
- Estimated self worth is not more than others. 

Patient
- Tolerates delay or suffering in pursuing goals.

Brave / Courageous
- Does what they think is right, even when it is difficult, or they are scared.

Honesty
- Holds truth sacred, in all areas of your life. 

Values
- Family
- Truth
- Nature

To expand on:
- Importance of communication
- Environmentalism and a love and respect for nature
- Relationship with materialism
- Financial literacy
- Responsibility
- Purpose
- Accountable
- Mature
- Long vs. Short term thinking
- Industrious: take what's around you, and make something of it
- Merit: Get what you earn, work for what you get.
