title: Breathing

Breathing is overlooked. Not that anyone would argue it is not important, but it is commonly taken for granted. Few people consider that breathing is a skill, that can be done either well or poorly. Few people realize that breathing influences digestion, cognition and emotions.

### What happens during a breath?
Air enters and leaves our bodies through nostrils or the mouth, in 4 combinations: in nose out nose, in nose out mouth, in mouth out mouth, in mouth out nose.

Air generally consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, .04% carbon dioxide, and other trace elements (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth#Composition). It also contains water vapour (humidity).

Our blood is composed of x% oxygen, and y% carbon dioxide.

Once in our lungs:
  - Oxygen moves from air to blood
  - Carbon dioxide moves from blood to lungs, and is exhaled.


### Notes

- Critical, yet ignored. Works so well it's taken for granted? What else is similar. Where do we spend our attention?
